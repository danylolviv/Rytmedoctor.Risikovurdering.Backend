# Rytmedoctor.Risikovurdering.Backend

# To develop a Stroke Risk Assessment form, which should be able to calculate a stroke risk percentage based on user input.

# The system should allow admins to adjust (CRUD) the different parameters and input options of the assessment form and assign their “weight”.

# Similar to Google Forms, but where the admin can determine the weight of each user choice.
